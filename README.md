# CSS Animation Border

This CSS animation creates a dynamic border effect with a rotating gradient and glowing outline. It's suitable for enhancing the visual appeal of elements on your webpage.

## How to Use

1. **HTML Setup:**
   Include the following HTML structure in your webpage where you want the animated border to appear:

   ```html
   <div class="center-box">
     <div class="animated-border-box">
       <!-- Your content here -->
     </div>
   </div>
   ```

2. **CSS Linking:**
   Link your HTML file to the CSS file containing the animation styles. For example, if your CSS file is named `styles.css`, add the following line in the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
   ```

3. **Customization:**
   - Adjust the dimensions of the border by modifying the `max-height` and `max-width` properties in the `.animated-border-box` class.
   - Change the border colors and gradient rotation speed by altering the respective properties in the CSS code.
   - Experiment with different values to achieve the desired visual effect.
